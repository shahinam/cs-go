## Algorithm
`Definition:` A finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation.

An algorithm has five important features:
1. Finiteness
2. Definiteness
3. Input
4. Output
5. Effectiveness

## Why Algorithms?
Enable to do tasks which are otherwise impossible.

## Algorithmic Analysis
Given an algorithm, we want to determine its performance characteristics.

Scientific Method of analysing alogorithm:
* Develop hypotheses about performance.
* Create mathamatical models.
* Run experiments to test them.
* Repeat the process as necessary.
